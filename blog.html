        <h2>What Difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
        <p>
          sessionStorage is similar to localStorage. The difference is that
          while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
          cleared when the page session ends.

        <h2>What difference between global scope vs block scope?</h2>
        <p>
          In javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other
          functions and variables are contained in this global scope. Another is
          the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are
          considered to be of the local scope and it is further divided into
          function scoped and block scoped.

        <h2>how event loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
          Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
          the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
          which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
          Event Loop.

        <h2>When we get undefined in javascript?</h2>
        <p>
          A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A
          method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
          being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
          undefined if a value was not returned.
