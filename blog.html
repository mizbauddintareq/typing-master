        <h2>What Difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
        <p>
          sessionStorage is similar to localStorage. The difference is that
          while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
          cleared when the page session ends.

        <h2>What difference between global scope vs block scope?</h2>
        <p>
          In javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other
          functions and variables are contained in this global scope. Another is
          the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are
          considered to be of the local scope and it is further divided into
          function scoped and block scoped.
